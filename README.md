# Handwriting Recognition
Handwriting Recognition project

## What is in the Code folder?
1) `segmentation.py` handles the line and character segmentation of input test images. Run `python3 segmentation.py -h` for help
2) `visualizer.py` handles intermediate results visualization (such as the images we use in the presentations), this file should not be directly run.
